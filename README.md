## JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript implementation (`Binary_Search_Trees.js`) consists of classes for representing nodes and binary search trees.

### Node Class

The `Node` class represents each node in the binary search tree. Each node has a `data` attribute to store the node's value, as well as `left` and `right` attributes to reference its left and right children.

### Tree Class

The `Tree` class represents the binary search tree itself. It has methods for building a balanced tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, finding nodes, traversing the tree in various orders (level order, in-order, pre-order, post-order), calculating heights and depths, checking if the tree is balanced, and rebalancing the tree.

## Ruby Implementation

The Ruby implementation (`binary_search_trees.rb`) also includes classes for representing nodes and binary search trees.

### Node Class

Similar to the JavaScript implementation, the `Node` class in Ruby represents each node in the binary search tree. It has attributes for `data`, `left`, and `right` children.

### Tree Class

The `Tree` class represents the binary search tree in Ruby. It provides methods for building a balanced tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, finding nodes, traversing the tree in various orders (level order, in-order, pre-order, post-order), calculating heights and depths, checking if the tree is balanced, and rebalancing the tree.

## Usage

To use either implementation, simply include the respective JavaScript or Ruby file (`Binary_Search_Trees.js` or `binary_search_trees.rb`) in your project. You can then create instances of the `Tree` class and perform various operations on the binary search tree.
